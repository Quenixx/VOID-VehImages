# VOID-VehImages
 A collection of ALL (some military and other blacklisted in the server was not included, over 150+ addon vehicles also included) vehicles PNG with transparent background images from gta cars. (Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC). Feel free to use them in your server / script :)

All the images are named after the car model, which should give you a quick plug-and-play process for your own scripts :)

# UPDATE 1.0.1
Cropped ALL images to correct size and get rid of unnecessary transparent background which made the cars smaller when used.
